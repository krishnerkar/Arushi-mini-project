Mini project for SE and DBMS


## Functionality : 

- As a designer, I should be able to upload a customer print as a png, jpg and then refer it back in my print catalog. As a designer I should also be able to insert a list of materials I want to buy. The system should generate a list with the material details (supplier and price and everything) based on which is the cheapest kit and which kit can be delivered the fastest. This way I will pay only once for all materials from different suppliers.
   
- As a supplier I should be able to log in and well add, delete, update my supply catalog. Add materials, increase qty and decrease qty. As well as look at my orders.

   
- As a manufacturer, I need to be able to look at the design the designer has uploaded and the material list they have uploaded. I should be able to look at the bulk orders and deliver it
